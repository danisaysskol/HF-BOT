## Women Empowerment
Half of the population of Pakistan comprises of women and the majority belongs to the underprivileged segment of the society. Due to the poor infrastructure & transport limitations for potential earning opportunities, it becomes very difficult for these women to find jobs for themselves.
Multiple vocational training programs and workshops can be sponsored for women in current and upcoming trades across Pakistan from Tailoring & Industrial Stitching to Beauty Therapy and Hair Cutting/Coloring, Call Center Training to Personality Grooming and Basic MS Office to Graphic Designing.
## Our Goal
Our goal is to train & certify **100,000+** young men & women annually by **2025-26** and transform them into Agents of Change.
