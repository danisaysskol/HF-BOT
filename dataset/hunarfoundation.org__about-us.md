##  About Us 
###  THE JOURNEY BEGINS 
## THF Story
More than a decade ago, a group of like-minded individuals realized that a majority of the youth of Pakistan, particularly in the middle and lower-income segments, after completing their high school, lost their direction and had no guidance or counselling about their future careers.
Also, as a fast-developing economy, there was a growing requirement for skilled manpower in Pakistan across multiple sectors and thus narrowing the gap between demand and supply of skills. Hence, there was a compelling need to launch a world-class skill development platform that would impart skills to the marginalized youth of our country. Thus, an idea was born and The Hunar Foundation (THF) came into being in 2008.

## THF Essence
The Hunar Foundation (THF) is a Not-for-Profit Organization (NPO), established in 2008 by a group of like-minded Pakistanis, to empower and enable the marginalized youth of Pakistan with vocational and technical skills. THF’s objective is to act as a catalyst in the field of education for catalytic action and increase the number of youth engaged in productive work, consequently alleviating poverty and making them contributing members of the society.
Today, THF is Pakistan’s largest private-sector NPO in the TVET category, committed to its vision, which is to train and certify more than 100,000 students annually by 2025-26. This will equip our youth with advanced vocational and technological skills, that will enable them to gain employment locally & globally and thus transform them into bread earners.
THF USA, Canada and UK are tax-exempt registered charities of The Hunar Foundation.
