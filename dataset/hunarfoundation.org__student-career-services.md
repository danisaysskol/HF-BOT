###  Placement Strategy of THF 
## Bridging Dreams To Careers
### Liaison with Industries
The Placement Department within Industrial Linkages Office (ILO) builds relationships with HR officials in related industries by visiting their organizations and presenting credentials of students, arranging interviews in institute and on company location and following up with employers.
The department extracts the real need of each organization at the right time before passing out of a particular batch of students as requirements by one company may vary from the other company.
Placement Department lists the opportunities with requirements from specific organizations.
### Recruitment Agencies
Relationships are maintained with local/international recruitment agencies to help THF students get placed locally/internationally.
The Placement department searches directly for international jobs in related fields and facilitates negotiation of terms and condition, if possible, making it favorable to the students.
### Exhibitions / Job Fairs
Exhibitions/Job Fairs are organized at each institute. This helps in developing close relationship with employer Federations, Trade Association and Chamber of Commerce in Karachi and other industrial cities.
